     <p class="blockText"> After their fiftieth anniversary, it is the custom for couples with such longevity to move into their very own memory box. They did, with the help of her daughter and the in-law. Sweaty handprints on cardboard boxes, the labored pilgrimage of a couch up the front steps, packing up a lifetime of possessions: knick knacks, dolls, colorful printed silks, decaying photographs. It seemed strange, that a lifetime could amount to so little. </p>

     <p class="blockText"> In the story my father used to tell,Ma Liang was a hero. Of course,back then I was just a kid living in the Old Country. And the story was only a story, and made sense in my head. For as far back as I can remember, he'd always tell it on my birthdays. We established a tradition. I'd finish my celebratory bowl of noodles, look at him across the table, clear my throat and ask: "Can you tell me the one about Shen Bi Ma Liang ?" And he'd grin, exposing those crooked yellow peasant-teeth, and begin the tale. </p>
